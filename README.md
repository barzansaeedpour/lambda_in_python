# Lambda Functions in Python

This repository is dedicated to showcasing examples of lambda functions in Python. 

## What are lambda functions?

Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are a type of function in Python that are defined without a name. They are typically used when you need a small, one-time use function that you don't want to define separately. Lambda functions are often used in combination with built-in functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`, which take a function as an argument.

## Examples

This repository contains several examples of lambda functions in Python, including:

- Basic syntax of lambda functions
- Sorting a list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple
- Filtering a list of strings based on a specific condition
- Mapping a function to each element of a list
- Reducing a list of numbers to a single value

## How to use this repository

You can clone this repository to your local machine and run the Python files to see the lambda functions in action. Each file contains a brief explanation of what the lambda function does and how it works.
